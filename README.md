## Project Overview

This project implements a RISC-V-based SoC, focusing on communication applications. The design aims to provide a customizable, open-source hardware solution for research and development in digital communication systems.

### Objectives

- Develop a RISC-V CPU core compatible with the RV32I instruction set.
- Integrate communication peripherals (UART, SPI, etc.) for real-world interfacing.
- Provide testbenches and simulation support for verification.
- Enable extensibility for future enhancements or custom accelerators.

## Features

- **RISC-V CPU Core:** Implements the base RV32I instruction set.
- **Communication Peripherals:** UART, SPI, and other modules for data transfer.
- **Memory Subsystem:** On-chip RAM and support for memory-mapped I/O.
- **Verilog HDL:** All modules written in synthesizable Verilog.
- **Testbenches:** Simulation environments for module verification.
- **Documentation:** Source code is documented for ease of understanding and extension.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Verilog simulator (e.g., Icarus Verilog, ModelSim)
- Make (for build automation)
- Python (optional, for scripts)

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kashaf619/FYDP-11-2021-RISC-V-SoC-for-Communication.git
cd FYDP-11-2021-RISC-V-SoC-for-Communication
```

## Usage

### Simulating the SoC

1. Navigate to the `tb/` directory.
2. Run the simulation using your preferred tool (e.g., Icarus Verilog):

```bash
cd tb
make
```

### Synthesizing the Design

Check the `synthesis/` folder for synthesis scripts and instructions for your preferred FPGA/ASIC toolchain.

## Testing

Testbenches are provided in the `tb/` directory for key modules. Use your Verilog simulator to verify functionality:

```bash
cd tb
make test
```
