# FYDP2021-RISCV-for-SOC
# RISCV for System on Chip (SoC)

This project implements a 32-bit RISC-V processor-based System on Chip (SoC) that communicates with external devices through UART and I2C serial communication protocols. The system is designed for efficient processing and transfer of 32-bit data words using a pipelined RISC-V core integrated with memory, UART, and I2C interfaces.

## üöÄ Overview

The system allows a user (master) to send 32-bit data to the RISC-V processor through a UART interface. The processor then executes instructions from an instruction memory (IMEM) to process the data. The resulting data is sent back to a slave device via the I2C protocol. External memory modules (IMEM & DMEM) are used for instruction and data storage.

## üîÅ Functional Flow

1. **Data Input (UART)**  
   Master sends 32-bit data words to the processor through UART.

2. **Instruction Execution (RISC-V)**  
   Processor fetches instructions from IMEM and processes input data accordingly.

3. **Data Output (I2C)**  
   Output data is sent to the slave device using I2C protocol.
